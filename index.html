        In the video, I accidentally used the tag 'p'.
        However, we are using the title tag instead of the accidentally used paragraph tag.
        The title tag defines the document/page's title shown in the title bar of the browser on the page's tab.
        You may read more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title
        More Information will be available on the title tag when I update it and explain it more in the next episode.
        Sorry for the inconvience.
